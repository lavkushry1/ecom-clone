npm run firebase:setup

# Initialize Firebase project
firebase init

# Configure environment variables in .env.local
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
# ... other Firebase config variables
```

### 2. Database Setup & Sample Data

```bash
# Deploy Firestore security rules
npm run firebase:deploy

# Seed database with sample products
npm run seed

# Create admin user
npm run create-admin
```

### 3. Cloud Functions Deployment

The project includes Cloud Functions in `/functions/` directory:
- Payment processing functions
- Order management functions  
- Notification functions
- Inventory management functions

```bash
cd functions
npm install
npm run deploy
```

### 4. Environment Variables Setup

Create `.env.local` with the following structure:

```env
# Firebase Client Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=

# Firebase Admin Config (Server-side)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=

# Payment Gateway (if using external provider)
PAYMENT_GATEWAY_API_KEY=
PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SECRET=

# Other Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yoursite.com
```

### 5. Testing & Validation

```bash
# Run development server
npm run dev

# Test build
npm run build

# Test production
npm run start

# Run type checking
npm run type-check
```
